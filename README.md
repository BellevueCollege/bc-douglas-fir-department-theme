# Bellevue College "Douglas Fir" Theme

This is Bellevue College's "Douglas Fir" theme for college departments. It is a successor to the "Mayflower G4" theme, with functionality not related to department websites removed.

## Naming Conventions

This theme adopts 'evergreens of Washington' as the naming convention for in-house themes. The theme is named after the Douglas Fir, a tree native to the Pacific Northwest.

When a new major version of this theme needs to be released (in this case, major is defined as needing to be run in parallel with the previous version), the new theme should be created in a new repo, and named after another tree from the Pacific Northwest. For inspiration, see [this list of trees native to Washington](https://www.wfpa.org/sustainable-forestry/tree-species/).
